# Qwik Environment Variables Demystified ⚡️

This project aims to provide insights into what variables are loaded from the `.env` and log how they flow through the `Qwik` application's lifecycle.

You can either watch the video explaining this lifecycle, or install the repo locally to experiment yourself.

**NOTE:** This is not intended to be a full guide on environment variables, but only a template project that outputs variables in each context.

## Installation

**METHOD A:**

1. `git clone` this project to your local system
2. `cd` into the project directory

**METHOD B:** *(Clean Qwik install and copy files):*

1. `pnpm create qwik@latest`
2. `cd` into the new project
